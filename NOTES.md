# Productivity Tools for Prototyping with Jupyter 

**(...and other useful stuff.)**

**So far we have:**

- Converting notebooks to julia files and modules
- ...

**To-do:**

- NBX parser, collect nbx cells and bin them by filename, to be able to create multiple files or separating regular code from test code.
- `#nbx` collect example code, and add as a long multi line comnet at the top or so.... within a file description or so...
- AWS lib, have an init function to enter location for config file and so on, have ssh store the info there
- julia notebooks, enable tests ...
